# EMS Test Data
This is a repository to store test data to help developers of Event Management Systems (EMS).

The data represents fictional health events in the lives of a set of fictional children.

The test data files are either:
* FHIR event messages as described in [Digital Child Health Service - Events Catalogue](https://nhsconnect.github.io/Digital-Child-Health/Generated/Chapter.1.About/index.html)
* A demographic record (definition to be determined)
